Let a version of Among Us with a new type of agent: spies.
Spies can lie or tell the truth at will. 
You are in the Cafetaria and you are approached by three characters  wearing different colored clothes. 
You know that one is a knight (i.e., crewmate), one is a knave (i.e., impostor), and one is a spy. 
They speak in the following order:
The man wearing blue says, "I am a knight (crewmate)."
The man wearing red says, "He speaks the truth."
The man wearing green says, "I am a spy."
